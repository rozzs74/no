1.) Networking sockets - is an internal endpoint for sending or receiving data at single node in a 
computer network.

2.) Socket - is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running
on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify 
the application that data is destined to be sent to.

3.) TCP (Transmission control protocol) - is a connection-oriented transport protocl that sends data as an unstructured stream of bytes.
By using sequence numbers and acknowledgement messages. TCP can provide a sending node with delivery information about packets transmitted
to a destination node. Where data has been lost in transit from source to destination, TCP can retransmit the data until either
timeout condition is reached or unitl successful delivery has been achievedl. TCP an end-to-end reliable transport.

4.) Telnet - is a protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

5.) Nc(Netcat) - (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. 

6.) Unix sockets - or IPC socket (inter-process communication socket) is a data communications endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. 

7.) TCP/UDP - (transmission control protocol) and (user data gram protocol)  https://www.howtogeek.com/190014/htg-explains-what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp/
